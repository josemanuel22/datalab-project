# Datalab-project

Part of my code for the Datalab project developed for the `European Southern Observatory` (ESO).

## What is inside

It contains among other things many `Dockers` with images of the installed databases (`Elasticsearch`, `Cassandra`, `Elasandra`, etc). Puppet files to automatically install docker compose. `Python` scripts, `c++` to parse, inject the data into the databases. Installation also of `Kibana`, `Grafana`, etc. and '
`Dockers` with own miscellaneous applications.

Everything is a little messy.
