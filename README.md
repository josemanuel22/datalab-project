# Datalab-project

Datalab project developed for the European Southern Observatory.

## What is inside

It contains among other things many Docker with images of the installed databases (elasticsearch, cassandra, elasandra, etc). Puppet files to automatically install docker compose. Python scripts, c ++ to parse, inject the data into the databases. Installation also of Kibana, grafana, etc. And docker with own miscellaneous applications.

Everything is a little messy.
